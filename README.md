ProductManager
==============
This was my end of course project on the Android Technology course at Cork Training Centre, Ireland.
This allows an Android smartphone to be used to manage stock levels for a shop. It uses a barcode scanner 
and REST technology to connect to a remote database. It also connects to a UPC database to retrieve product details.
Also uses a SQLite database.
